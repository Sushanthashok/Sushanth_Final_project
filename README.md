# Solar Panel Defect Detection using CNN (Sustainability Theme)



# Project Problem Statement

As the world transitions toward renewable energy, solar power stands as one of the most promising sources for a sustainable and low-carbon future. However, the efficiency of solar panels declines when they develop defects such as bird drops, dust accumulation, electrical damage, physical cracks, or snow coverage.
Manual inspection of large-scale solar farms is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error, leading to significant energy loss and maintenance delays.

To address this challenge, this project proposes an AI-powered Solar Panel Defect Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
By analyzing solar panel images, the model automatically detects and classifies defects into categories such as Bird-drop, Clean, Dusty, Electrical Damage, Physical Damage, and Snow-Covered.
This enables proactive maintenance, enhances energy output, and supports the global mission of achieving sustainable renewable energy generation.

# Sustainability Focus

This project directly supports the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

SDG 13: Climate Action

By integrating artificial intelligence into renewable energy systems, this project promotes:

Higher operational efficiency of solar farms.

Reduced energy waste and carbon emissions.

Predictive maintenance through data-driven insights.

Smart energy management for a sustainable future.
